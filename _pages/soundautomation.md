## Joel's Sound Automation

Joel's sound automation is part 2 of a 3 part work-calendar scheduling automation. 

It's job is to:
* Convert the new schedule Excel file into a Google Sheets file
* Remove any row with a strike-through
* Put the excel file name and ID into a Google Sheets file with the correct form for part 3 of the automation

## Privacy Policy

Joel's sound automation will not access, modify, or remove any data from any Google Drive except Joel's Google Drive. This app will not access anyone else's data even if they add the app to their system because it is hard coded for Joel's personal automation scheduling system.
