## Privacy Policy

Joel's sound automation will not access, modify, or remove any data from any Google Drive except Joel's Google Drive. This app will not access anyone else's data even if they add the app to their system because it is hard coded for Joel's personal automation scheduling system.

## Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy for Joel's Sound Automation Effective Date: *November 7, 2025*

**1** - Introduction
"Joel's Sound Automation" (the "Script") is a personal automation tool created in Google Apps Script. It is owned and operated by Joel Logan (the "Developer").

This Script is **not** intended for public use. It is a private tool designed solely for the Developer's personal workflow. It does not access, read, or modify any data from any Google Account other than the Developer's own account. The Script's connections to specific files and folders are hard-coded.

**2** - How the Script Accesses and Uses Data
To function, the Script requires access to the Developer's Google Account. This access is used only for the following specific tasks:

A. Google Drive (.../auth/drive) This permission is required to:

- Read Excel files (.xls, .xlsx) from a specific, hard-coded Google Drive folder.

- Create new Google Sheets files (conversions of the Excel files) within that same folder.

- Delete (move to trash) the original Excel files after they have been successfully converted to prevent duplicate processing.

B. Google Sheets (.../auth/spreadsheets) This permission is required to:

- Write to a specific, hard-coded "index" Google Sheet, appending a new row with the file name and ID of the newly created sheet for logging purposes.

- Open the newly created Google Sheet by its ID.

- Read the cell formatting (specifically, for strikethrough text) within the new Google Sheet.

- Delete rows from the new Google Sheet if they contain strikethrough text.

**3** - How Data is Stored and Shared
Storage: All data accessed and generated by the Script remains within the Developer's own Google Account (in Google Drive and Google Sheets). No data is copied, downloaded, or stored in any external database or third-party service.

Sharing: Google user data is never shared with any third party. The Script does not have any function to export, email, or transmit data to any other service or user.

**4** - Limited Use Policy
This Script's use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

**5** - Contact
For any questions about this privacy policy, please contact the developer, Joel Logan.
