## Hello And Welcome

My name is Joel Logan, and I am a Bob Jones University Computer Science student who has an interest in Software Development as a career. 

## Other Activities

I've been making Minecraft plugins and mods on request for a few years, and my work can be found in my [Github](https://github.com/JoelLogan) or on the [Projects](https://joellogan.com/projects) page.

When I'm not coding or learning, I enjoy some simple DJing. I sometimes work with [Greenwood DJ](https://www.greenwooddj.com/) on some events. 

#### Thanks For Stopping By!
